# PhD-Thesis - Abstract (partial)

The total Internet trafic in 2018 was around 1.2 ZettaBytes with a cost of 0.82
GWh. In the same year more than 1451 billions of videos on Youtube were viewed
and more than 16 billions of pictures were uploaded on Instagram, while the total
number of Facebook active users was more than 2.2 billion. These numbers show
the fact that global Internet traficc is expanding at a high rate. Therefore, the
global Internet trafic in 2018 is approximately 20000GB/second in comparison
with 0.001GB/second in the early 90's. Therese significant numbers set the plot
for an interconnected environment that shares media content, sensors data or
computing data in an ubiquitous manner. Internet of Things and Smart*, as well
as ubiquitous computing concepts, have become very well spared in the last years
especially with the growth of mobile data bandwidth from 3G to 4G networks and
the highly advances in the development of the 5G networks. This evolution has
led to a new type of ubiquitous connectivity through devices in an unconventional
manner. The deprecated, client-server approach is not anymore feasible in this
new ecosystem, therefore the Peer-to-Peer concept is more suitable.
The shift of paradigm from server-based computation to user-centric paradigm
is mandatory because increasing the centralized cloud data centers causes a
significant decrease in the Quality of Service and Quality of Experience of the
network systems. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are the research
and implementation of auto-adaptive Peer-to-Peer overlay systems that can be
used for large scale heterogeneous networks in the Internet of Things, Smart-*
or ubiquitous computing ecosystems. The heterogeneity and the lack of
reliability of the interconnected devices in large scale systems represent one of
the most challenging research topics in the Peer-to-Peer systems. Therefore, the
main problem addressed in this thesis is the robustness auto-adaptive
Peer-to-Peer overlays.
